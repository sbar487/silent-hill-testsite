    <h2>Silent Hill 2</h2>
    <p>Silent Hill 2 centers on James Sunderland, a widower who journeys to the town of Silent Hill after receiving a letter from his dead wife</p>

    <p> Development of Silent Hill 2 began in June 1999, soon after Silent Hill had been completed. Its narrative was inspired by the Russian novel Crime and Punishment (1866) by Fyodor Dostoevsky, and some of the influences on the game's artistic style include the work of film director David Lynch and paintings by Francis Bacon and Andrew Wyeth; cultural references to history, films and literature can be found in the game. In contrast with the previous title, whose narrative concerned cult activity, Silent Hill 2 focuses directly on the psychology of its characters. </p>

<p>The objective of Silent Hill 2 is to guide the player character, James Sunderland, through the monster-filled town of Silent Hill as he searches for his deceased wife. The game features a third-person view, with various camera angles. The default control for Silent Hill 2 has James moving in the direction that he is facing when the player tilts the analog stick upwards, although players can choose a more traditional control scheme. Silent Hill 2 does not use a heads-up display; to check James' health, location, and items, the player must enter the pause-game menu to review his status. Throughout the game, James collects maps, which can only be read if there is sufficient light or when his flashlight is on. He also updates relevant maps to reflect locked doors, clues, and obstructions, and writes down the content of all documents for future reference. Maps are not essential to proceed through the game, but they will give a significant advantage to exploring the world.</p>

<p>Much of the gameplay consists of navigating the town and finding keys or other items to bypass doors or other obstructions, with less focus on killing enemies. Occasionally, puzzles will be presented, often with riddles left for the player to interpret. The difficulty levels of the enemies and the puzzles are determined independently by the player before starting the game. James keeps a radio with him, which alerts him to the presence of creatures by emitting static, allowing him to detect them even through the thick fog or darkness. Similar to the first game, the player can choose to turn off the radio if they want. He also tilts his head in the direction of a nearby item or monster, giving clues to items that the player may miss while playing. For combat, he finds three melee weapons and three firearms throughout the game, with another two melee weapons unlocked during replays. James can move and shoot while equipped with a handgun, but he cannot move and shoot with a shotgun or rifle. James cannot aim up or down and the player will have to rely on the game's auto-aim to hit enemies that are on the ceiling. "Health" restoratives and ammunition can be found throughout the game.</p>

<p>In North America, Japan, and Europe, over one million copies of Silent Hill 2 were sold, with the greatest number of sales in North America. Critics praised its psychological horror story, use of symbolism and taboo topics, atmosphere, graphics, monster designs, soundtrack, sound design, and emotional depth. It is considered to be one of the best video games of all time. The game was followed by Silent Hill 3 in 2003 as well as a remake later in the year 2024.</p>
